### About Threads

The advantage of threading is the ability to create applications that use more than one thread of execution. For example, a process can have a user interface thread that manages interactions with the user and worker threads that perform other tasks while the user interface thread waits for user input.
This game - example demonstrates how to create and start a thread, and shows the interaction between two threads running simultaneously within the same process. Note that you don't have to stop or free the thread. This is done automatically by the .NET Framework common language runtime.
